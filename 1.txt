                    the region. Other symptoms may also include a change in colour of the breast, alteration in the
                    structure of the nipple or abnormal discharge from the nipple. (read more about the symptoms of

                    bloodstream.
                    Early detection plays a vital role in this regard, increasing the chances of survival.</p>

                    Humanity has made significant strides when it comes to the fight against Breast Cancer. According to
                    the American Cancer Society the 5-year relative survival rate has increased by a magnanimous amount.
                    Technological advancements have also ensured progress in detection and prognosis. Unfortunately, the
                    battle rages on with almost half a million women falling prey to this disease every year. The need
                    to spread awareness and research on ways to cure/detect cancer tumours continues to exist.
